# Notes for 2018

"DESeq2" lab:
- phase out alignment based counting, only do salmon-based.
- integrate IHW as a default (?)

Add lecture and lab on single - cell biology
- invite Aaron Lun (?), Davis McCarthy (?)

May be also pore-sequencing

Machine-learning:
- unsupervised: add multi-omics factor analysis



- Reduce Intro to R and Bioc to one lecture (to save time for the above) ?
- Visualisation lecture on first day ?
