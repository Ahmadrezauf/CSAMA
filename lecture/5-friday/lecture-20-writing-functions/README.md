Will be based on this series of lessons re: Writing your own R functions:

  * [Part 1](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-01.html): Incremental process, informal testing, sanity checking arguments.
  * [Part 2](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-02.html): Generalize from an important special case, naming arguments, returning, default values.
  * [Part 3](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-03.html): `NA` management, what is `...`, unit testing.
  
Before or right after lecture, I will post source code and rendered version of exactly what we are able to walk through live.
