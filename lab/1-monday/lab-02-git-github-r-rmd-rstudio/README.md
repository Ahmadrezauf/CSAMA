Please see <http://happygitwithr.com> for all material. Here's the underlying GitHub repo: <https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r>.

I usually run this interactively as a group, but you should be able to walk through the activities on your own.

## Slides

Why can you get from the slides? You'll get more motivation and context.

## Hands-on activities

#### Pre-requisites

We asked you to install and setup prior to CSAMA.

Installation:

-   [Register a GitHub account](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
-   [Install or upgrade R and RStudio](http://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html)
-   [Install Git](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
-   [Introduce yourself to Git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)

Configure and test connections (Git, GitHub, RStudio):

-   [Connect to GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html)
-   One of:
    -   [Cache credentials for HTTPS](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)
    -   [Set up keys for SSH](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html)
-   [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)

Help and troubleshooting if things go sideways:

-   [Detect Git from RStudio](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html)
-   [RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell](http://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html)

Setup is harder than early usage! So take advantage of the CSAMA TAs and instructors to work out any problems.

#### Main activities

I suggest you work through these in the lab:

-   [New project, GitHub first](http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
-   [Test drive R Markdown](http://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html)

And if time permits, more good early usage of Git/GitHub/R/RStudio:

-   [Existing project, GitHub first](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html)
-   [Clone a repo](http://happygitwithr.com/clone.html) or [Fork a repo](http://happygitwithr.com/fork.html)
-   [Burn it all down](http://happygitwithr.com/burn.html)
